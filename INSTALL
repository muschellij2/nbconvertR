Installation instructions
=========================
Follow these instructions to install the SystemRequirements.

On Linux, use your system package manager to install everything, e.g. one of

    sudo apt install pandoc jupyter jupyter-nbconvert
    sudo pacman -S pandoc jupyter-nbconvert
    sudo dnf install pandoc python3-nbconvert

You are now done. On Windows or macOS, you need to install them manually:

1.  For pandoc, see https://pandoc.org/installing.html
2.  If you don’t have Python 3.6 or later already,
    run the installer from https://www.python.org/downloads/
    Make sure you check “Add Python 3.x to PATH”!
3.  To install the packages, make sure `python --version` says “3.6” or later and run

        python -m pip install jupyter nbconvert

    If you have problems, see https://docs.python.org/3/installing/,
    https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html or https://docs.python.org/3/using/mac.html

4.  If pip warned you “The script jupyter is installed in '...' which is not on PATH”,
    you need to add that directory, see https://superuser.com/a/284351/67265

Once you’re done, running `jupyter nbconvert --version` from a shell should give you output.
If you start R from the same shell (not e.g. R.app on macOS), nbconvertR will work.
